    	<h2> Why I Want to Join Toptal</h2>
        <br>
        <span style="font-size:80%">We overvalue people starting companies, and we undervalue asking 
        if there is a really valuable company <br>you should try to join instead. <br>-Peter Thiel </span>
        <br><br>
        <p>The reasons I want to join Toptal fall into two categories. First is the way the company recruits and conducts its
        business. The concept of a company where entry is based entirely on merit is one that has yet to pervade the mainstream. 
        I simply love the idea of a corporate meritocracy. I hope I have what it takes - but if I don't then the experience
        will still have been refreshing and new.</p>
        
        <p>The second and most important category of reasons why I want to join Toptal, is what the company
        is doing to the industry and to developers as a community. In a world where 
        technologists are obsessed with "disrupting," Toptal is taking a different approach. Instead of destroying value 
        for others by creating entropic, free-for-all peer-to-peer markets for any good or service imaginable, Toptal is creating 
        value by undoing the damage caused by this free-for-all economy. As someone who has hired freelancers online multiple
        times and been almost universally dissatisfied, I know the frustration that goes with sifting through 1500
        applications for a gig and then making the wrong choice. In many cases it felt I could have done the work myself for
        less effort. The situation is no less dire when seen from the developer's point of view - they can spend a whole workday 				 		bidding on projects and bring home zero dollars at the end of the day.</p>
        
        <p>This frenetic free-for-all that is the online freelancing community is (or was) hurting developers, not helping. 
        As someone 
        who went through very difficult times after the crash of 2008 - and who is in many ways still recovering from the
        financial fallout of those years - I have always wanted to do something to help the country fight against the structural
        inefficiencies and the economic friction that renders talented, hard-working people unable to find jobs that
        fairly compensate them. I think Toptal is helping in this regard. I want to join Toptal as a developer at first but  
        eventually my aim is to make it to a place within the company where I contribute to this mission.</p>
        
        <p>I already play a part in empowering people in the labor market by bringing them the prime skill of the 21st century, 
        software development. I teach AP Computer Science at the High School where I manage the IT department. 
        By joining the Toptal team I think I will have the opportunity to multiply my efforts to empower our youth 
        because I will be a part of a team committed to fostering and nurturing extraordinary talent. 
        I have a lot of energy and ambition to offer Toptal, and the vision of
        developing and growing a community of elite developers is one that I celebrate. </p>
